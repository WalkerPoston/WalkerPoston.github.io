## Project description

This is the final project for CSCI 334 - User Interface Design. The project is supposed to be a mock-up of a website for a charity 5k run hosted by the Save the Rhinos Foundation. On the home page, it gives some details about the charity, its mission, and how it helps fund-raise for the charity. There is also a link for people to sign up for the race. The "Charity" page and the home page are the same and have the same information on them. The "Race Info" page gives details about the race including the date, time, and location of where the race will be taking place. The "Log In" is where a user logs into their account. The "Sign Up" page is where a user signs up to participate in the race.

Once a user has signed up for the race, they will have access to two new pages. The first page is their account page, which they will be taken to after they click the "Create my account" button. The second page is the "Race Day Details" page, which will show new information about the race including times for different events and a map of the race route. When the user is on their account page and clicks on the "Account" tab at the top, a drop-down menu will pop up with the options to view their profile, edit their profile, and log out. When they click "View Profile", they will be taken to their account where they will be able to see their account information, team members, and the race route. When they click "Edit Profile" they will see a page similar to the sign-up page, where they can update any information that they need to. When the user clicks "Log out", they will be logged out of their account and taken back to the home page.

For admins, there are an additional two pages, a "Users" page and a "Teams" page. On the "Users" page, the admin has the ability to delete a user's account, make a user an admin, and view the user's account information. On the "Teams" page, the admin has the ability to show, edit, delete, and create a new team. When the "Show" button is clicked all of the members on that team will be displayed. When the "Edit" button is clicked, the admin can edit the team name. When the "Delete" button is clicked, that team will be deleted. When the "New Team" button is clicked, the admin can create a new team.

## UI Design

This project resembles a website created for a charity 5k run to help raise money for the Save the Rhinos Foundation. For a user, the first thing they see when they load up the website is the home page that describes the foundation and its mission (Figure 1). In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, the next page is the Charity page, which is the exact same as the home page. After that, the next page is the login page which is for users that have already created an account (Figure 2). The next page is the sign-up page where people can sign up for the 5k (Figure 3). Once someone signs up for the 5k, they will be taken to their account page where all of their account information is listed (Figure 4). Also at the top, there will be two new tabs, one is the account tab which takes the user to their account page. The other one takes the user to the Race Day Details page, which gives additional information to the user regarding different events taking place at the race, the race's location, and a map outlaying the race route (Figure 5). If the user is an admin, then they will have two more additional tabs. One of the tabs is the Users tab, which shows all of the users who have signed up along with options to delete a user's account and to make a user an admin (Figure 6). The other tab is the Teams tab which shows all of the teams competing in the race (Figure 7). In the Teams tab, there are three options that an admin has, which are show, edit, and delete. The show option displays all the members of a team (Figure 8). The edit option allows an admin to edit the team name (Figure 9). The delete option allows an admin to delete a team (Figure 10).
